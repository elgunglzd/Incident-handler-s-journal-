# Incident-handler-s-journal-
An incident handler's journal, often referred to as an incident response journal or IR journal, is a log or documentation that records the activities and actions taken by incident response teams during the handling of a security incident. Security incidents can include events such as data breaches, malware infections, system intrusions, and other cybersecurity threats.

The purpose of an incident handler's journal is to provide a detailed and chronological account of everything related to the incident.
